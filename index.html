      <hr>

      <p> <span class="first-character">O</span>n March 13, 2020, the U.S. declared a state of emergency as a result of the Covid-19 virus sweeping the nation. Across the state of New York, college bound high school students and matriculated students experienced a sudden interruption to their education. With the shutdown of schools and the difficulty of online learning, students were faced with many hurdles in the efforts to pursue higher education. 
      </p>

      <p>Almost three years later, the pandemic's effects on higher education in New York and the ripples it has caused in the lives of students has become increasingly transparent. 
      </p>

      <p>In the state of New York, the impact of Covid-19 on the Tuition Assistance Program gives insight into how the pandemic disrupted higher education and shows the effects it has had on the accessibility of college for students. 
      </p>
      
      <p>TAP, which grants need-based scholarships to students attending colleges or universities from an approved list, provides aid for a large number of students every school year. The program helps to alleviate the financial burden for students in schools across New York State. 
      </p>

      <p>Like many of the effects of Covid-19, the cuts to TAP funding disproportionately impacts those who are already disadvantaged. The cuts made to funding the tuition program presents yet another boundary for students with preexisting financial barriers.   
      </p>

      <p>Data from the Higher Education Services Corporation points to a decrease in the amount of funding allotted to TAP. Data shows that less money has been distributed by TAP in the year 2020 than in 2019 and 2018. Similarly there have been significantly less people who have received money from the program in 2020. 
      </p>

      <p>“While many students put college plans on hold for financial or other reasons—at least for now—others who enrolled or who continued with their studies experienced unprecedented deepening fears about whether they could continue their education at all,” said the U.S Department of Education in a <a href= "https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/20210608-impacts-of-covid19.pdf"> report </a> made about the widespread effects of Covid-19 on higher education. “...the pandemic’s effects on pre-existing race- and ethnicity-based inequities, as indicated by early evidence, have been harsh and predictable,” said the department in acknowledgement of the disparate effects of Covid. 
      </p>

      <p>The financial impact of the pandemic, specifically the implications it has had for New York State and its students has been immense.

         <div class= "visualization #1">
         <iframe title="TAP Recipient Dollars by Year" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-g2Q3J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/g2Q3J/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="393" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script> 
        </div>

          
          <p>The year the pandemic hit, 700,000,000 dollars was distributed through TAP, while in the year 2019 approximately 840,000,000 dollars was distributed. 
          </p>

          <p>This is a 140,000,000 dollar decline in one year. </p>

          <p>To illuminate the severity of this number, a comparison can be made to the difference in funding from 2018 to 2019, which was a total of 45,000,000 dollars. The difference in funding from 2019 to 2020, is three times that amount.  </p>

          <p>As a result of less money being allocated to TAP, less students in the state are receiving aid.</p>

          <p>The data also shows that there has been a substantial decrease in the TAP recipient headcount, as only 250,000 students received money from TAP in total in 2020. Again, the differences in comparison to the years prior are stark. In 2019, 300,000 students received money, which is 50,000 more than in 2020. In 2018, 323,000 students received money, which is a little over a difference of 70,000.  
          </p>


          <p>The difference from 2019 to 2020 is about 2 times the difference seen from 2018 to 2019. 
          </p>

           </script>
         </div>

      <p>The decline in funding and students receiving money from TAP, is a serious consequence of the economic impact of the pandemic that affects students in their academic endeavors. The implications of Covid-19 on TAP echoes the reality of many need-based aid programs in the state, making it difficult for students with financial insecurity to afford their education. 
      </p>

      <p>After two years of the pandemic, higher education in New York has slowly returned to fully in-person instruction with little to no Covid restrictions seen on campuses. With instruction returning to pre-pandemic conditions, where does this leave New York State’s financial aid funding? 
      </p>


      <p>“Higher education students not only hold the key for our state, but for their families. A degree changes more than just the life of its holder, it changes the lives of those all around them. Every person who calls New York home should have the opportunity to better themselves and invest in their education. My administration is committed to supporting our students in every way possible and I thank my partners in service for making this a reality,” said Governor Hochul of New York when <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-launch-historic-150-million-expansion-tuition-assistance-program">announcing </a> an expansion that was made to TAP in August of this year. 
      </p>

      <p>The 150,000,000 dollar expansion was created by the state, with the goal of broadening the scope of aid to create access for part time students. Looking forward, the data has shown that students attending college in New York have suffered the consequences of decreases in TAP aid as a result of Covid, but the recent expansion and Governor Hochul’s expressed commitment to education points to hope for the future of accessible higher education. </p>
